<b> Ⲁϣ ⲡⲉ ⲡⲉⲕⲣⲏϯ? Explanation (Boharic)</b>

<b>Translation:</b> How are you?

ⲁϣ: General Question Word
ⲡⲉ: A copula (Note that it's not a verb)

ⲡⲉⲣⲏϯ: ⲡⲉ= your ⲣⲏϯ= condition/status : Your condition/status
- ⲡⲉ: The ⲡⲉ here is different that the copula above, when it is combined with a word it means your. It is a feminine second person (i.e. feminine you) possessive adjective for a masculine object
- ⲣⲏϯ: Condition/Status, a masculine word.

ⲡⲉⲕⲣⲏϯ: Your condition/status
ⲡⲉⲕ: masculine second person (i.e. masculine you) possessive adjective for a masculine object

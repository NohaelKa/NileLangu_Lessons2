<bold>الحصة الأولى "‏الحروف 2"‏

In this lesson you will learn the following letters:
ϯ, ⲟ, ϥ, ϣ, ⲣ, ⲡ


The following is a rough guide to the pronunciation:
ϯ^§: Pronounced as the two English letters "Di"
ⲟ^§: Pronounced as an English "O"
ϥ^§: Pronounced as an English "F"
ϣ^§: Pronounced as "Sh" as in
the English word “Sheep”
ⲣ^§: Pronounced as an English "R"
ⲡ^§: Pronounced as an English “B”


You will also see for first time indefinite singular articles.
For example, §ϣⲁⲩ^§ means cat, but
it cannot be written like this without
the indefinite singular article §ⲟⲩ^§.

To say "a cat" you should write
ⲟⲩϣⲁⲩ^§

Words you will learn:

ⲟⲩϣⲁⲩ^§: A cat
ⲁϣ^§: What
ⲣⲏϯ^§: Condition or State
When saying "How are you", it is expressed in Egyptian Coptic as "What is your condition?"
ⲕⲁϣⲣⲱⲙⲓ^§: Cairo
ⲣⲏⲙⲥⲓⲥ^§: Ramsis
ⲛⲟϥⲣⲓ^§: Hello

In this word you will see the first example a definite singular article for masculine objects
ⲡⲏⲓ^§:The home

ⲡ or ⲡⲓ are both masculine definite articles that mean "the".
So the word can also be written as ⲡⲓⲏⲓ.

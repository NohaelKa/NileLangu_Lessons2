The following is a rough guide to the pronounciation:
ⲑ^§: An English "T"
ⲛ^§: An English "N"
ⲟⲩ^§: English "oo" as in food
ⲉ^§: English "a" as in "at",
 it is a little lighter than ⲁ

In this letter you will see the symbol "`" above the letter, which is equivalent to a glottal plosive or a stop
̀ⲛ^§: "En"

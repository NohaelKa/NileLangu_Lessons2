Extra Explanation (Boharic)
ⲁϣ: what
ⲡⲉ: a copula (note that it's not a verb)
ⲡⲉ+word: Your (To a female, with masc noun)
ⲡⲉⲕ+word: Your (To a male, with masc noun)
ⲫ: masculine definite article (i.e. 'the') which comes before the following letters: ⲃ, ⲓ, ⲗ, ⲙ, ⲛ, ⲟ, and ⲣ. Otherwise we use 'ⲡ'. Note that there's also 'ⲡⲓ' which is more general and less specific.
ⲣⲏϯ: condition/status (حالة)
ⲙ: possession marker that comes before ⲡ, ⲫ, ⲃ, ⲙ and ⲯ (otherwise we use ⲛ). Like 'of' in English or 'de' in Spanish, it relates ⲣⲏϯ to ⲡⲉⲕⲉϩⲟⲟⲩ i.e. the status 'of' your day.
ⲡⲉⲕ: masculine 2nd person (i.e. masculine you) possessive adjective for a masculine object
ⲉϩⲟⲟⲩ: day/يوم/نهار (a masculine word)

I'm hungry
ϯϩⲟⲕⲉⲣ
دي هوكَر
ϯ: singular 1st person dependent pronoun in the first present tense (i.e. present tense). ⲁⲛⲟⲕ is the independent pronoun for the singular 1st person.
ϩⲟⲕⲉⲣ: hungry.
Note that in Coptic we don't conjugate verbs but we mainly change the dependent pronouns to reflect verb tenses.

Do we have food?
ⲟⲩⲟⲛⲧⲉⲛ ⲟⲩⲟⲩⲱⲙ?
وّوُن دَن أوُ وّوُم
ⲟⲩⲟⲛ: there is.
ⲟⲩⲟⲛ//: there is (with).
ⲧⲉⲛ: for the plural 1st person (i.e. English 'us').
ⲟⲩⲟⲛⲧⲉⲛ: there is with us (يوجد عندنا).
ⲟⲩ: singular indefinite article (i.e. English 'a').
ⲟⲩⲱⲙ: food (masculine word).
Note: you may also prepend the Greek 'ⲙⲏ' (مي) in the beginning for yes/no questions but I prefer not to use it.

like what?
You may use the following to ask about the type.
ⲁϣ `ⲛⲣⲏϯ?
آش إن رَدي
ⲁϣ: what?
ⲣⲏϯ: you already know it from the previous post!

You could also use something like:
ⲧⲉⲛⲟⲩⲱⲙ `ⲛⲟⲩ?
دَن وّوُم إن أوُ
ناكل ايه؟
ⲧⲉⲛ: plural 1st person dependent pronoun in the first present tense (i.e. English 'we'). I think the first future tense might be better in this case, but you only wanted to use the present tense.
ⲟⲩⲱⲙ: verb to eat.
ⲛⲟⲩ: what (ايه).
ⲧⲉⲛⲟⲩⲱⲙ `ⲛⲟⲩ?: what are we eating?

How is the meal?
ⲁϣ ⲡⲉ `ⲫⲣⲏϯ `ⲙ`ⲡⲟⲩⲱⲙ?
آش بَ إب رَدي إم إب وّوُم
ⲁϣ: what.
ⲡⲉ: copula (for masculine words).
`ⲫ: weak singular masculine definite article (i.e. English 'the') (comes before 'ⲣ', review your previous thread for more information). We use a weak definite article because both the speaker and the listener know exactly which meal they are talking about.
ⲣⲏϯ: condition/status.
`ⲙ: possession marker (review your previous thread for more information).
`ⲫ: singular masculine definite article.
ⲟⲩⲱⲙ: food.

It's great,
You could just say:
ⲛⲁⲛⲉϥ
نانَف
ⲛⲁⲛⲉ//: good
ϥ: ⲟⲩⲱⲙ is masculine word so we use 'ϥ' (if the word was feminine we use 'ⲥ'). Note that ⲛⲁⲛⲉⲥ can also be used to mean okay.
or
ⲛⲁⲛⲉϥ `ⲉⲟⲩⲱⲙ
نانَف أ وّوُم
شهيّ الأكل
`ⲉ: preposition that usually means 'to'.
ⲛⲁⲛⲉϥ `ⲉⲟⲩⲱⲙ: it's good to be eaten / it's good for eating.

You may append 'ϯϣⲉⲡϩⲙⲟⲧ ⲛⲧⲉⲛ ⲫⲛⲟⲩϯ' (الحمدلله) (دي شَب إهموت إندَن إبنودي) to the answers above.

I'm full!
I'm not sure about this one - I hope someone else will jump in and help - but you probably could use:
ϯⲥⲏⲟⲩ
دي سَوّ
Note that 'ⲥⲏⲟⲩ' can also mean 'time' (masculine word).

Rice
I'm not sure if there was a dedicated Coptic word for rice, but I've seen others use the word 'ⲁⲣⲣⲟⲥ' (masculine word) for rice which seems to either be a neologism (newly coined word) or a Greek loanword. I would just use 'ⲁⲣⲣⲟⲥ' (أرّوس) as it's the standard word for rice in many languages including Arabic.

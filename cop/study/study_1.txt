<bold>Lesson Number 1 "Letters"

Welcome to lesson 1 of "ϯⲙⲉⲧⲣⲉⲙⲉⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ" (dimedramen.kemi), Which means the Egyptian Language!
Kamit is what the Egyptians used to call Egypt, In modern times it is called Kami, as many of the "t" letter at the end of it, and many other words has been dropped.

Coptic is another name people have given to this last phase of the language, however technically Coptic is is the name of the script not the language.
Other names for other scripts are for example: Hieroglyphic, Hieratic and Demotic.

This course will teach you the Egyptian Language in the Coptic script. The Boharic variant is presented with inherited pronunciation not the ecclesiastical one.


In this lesson you will learn the following letters:
ⲁ, ϩ, ⲱ, ⲥ, ⲇ, ⲏ, ̣ⲏ

In the Coptic writing system, you can have capital and small letters, same as in English, but it is not mandatory and will not be used in this course.

The following is a rough guide to the pronunciation:
ⲁ^§: "A" as in "Art"

ϩ^§: English "H", but sometimes the Arabic "ح"

ⲱ^§: Long "O" as in the English word Bone

ⲥ^§: English "S"

ⲇ^§: English "D"

ⲏ^§: English "A", as in "Cake" (common)

̣ⲏ^§: English "ee" as in "Sweet" (less common)

ⲩ^§: English "u"

<bold>Good to Know:
According to the National Geographic, The word Copt comes from the way the Europeans pronounced the Arabic word "qibt".  And "qibt" is derived from the Greek name "Aigyptos".
Finally "Aigyptos" is derived from the word "Hwt-ka-ptah", which is a template in Memphis (مَنْف‎ ) dedicated to the Egyptian god Ptah.

The Modern Egyptian language with the Coptic script is the last evolution of the Egyptian language, its distinct features are the writing system which uses mostly Greek letters and has some Greek loan words.
There are 32 letters in this alphabet. The first 25 are derived
from the Greek letters that have their origin in the Egyptian
Hieroglyphic script, the last 7 letters are directly derived from the
Egyptian Demotic Script.

<bold>Lesson Number 5 "Letters"

In this lesson you will learn the following letters:
ⲧ, ϭ, ⲫ, ⲓ


The following is a rough guide to the pronunciation:

ⲧ^§: An English "D" frequently and an English "T" rarely.

ϭ^§: An English "Ch" as in the English word “Chair”

ⲫ^§: An English “B” , occasionally “F”.

ⲓ^§: An English "Y" or "I" depending.


You will also learn the following words:

ⲟⲩϭⲁϫ^§: A bird

ⲡⲓϭⲁϫ^§: The bird

ⲫⲓⲥⲓ^§: Cook

ϯⲫⲓⲥⲓ^§: I'm cooking

ⲧⲟⲟⲩⲓ^§: Morning

`ⲙⲫⲟⲟⲩ^§: Today

ⲟⲩⲓⲟⲙ^§: A sea

ⲫⲓⲟⲙ^§: The sea

Note: for §ⲫⲓⲟⲙ^§, it is a masculine noun
but the definite singular article is not ⲡⲓ, the reason is that before certain letters the ⲡⲓ must change to `ⲫ. In this case the letter ⲓ is one of those exception letters.

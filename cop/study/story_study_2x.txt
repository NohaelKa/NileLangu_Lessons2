Simple Present Tense (Verb to be):

The present tense is formed by pronoun or name + verb

To use present tense, you can use (is/are) same as in English:
ⲡⲉ is used for masculine singular
ⲧⲉ is used for feminine singular
ⲛⲉ is for plural
they are copulas (not a verb)

Lets break down this sentence: <b>ⲁϣ ⲡⲉ `ⲫⲣⲏϯ `ⲙⲡⲉⲉϩⲟⲟⲩ</b>
ⲁϣ: what
ⲡⲉ: a copula (note that it's not a verb)
ⲫ: masculine definite article (i.e. 'the') which always comes before the following letters: ⲃ, ⲓ, ⲗ, ⲙ, ⲛ, and sometimes ⲟⲩ, and ⲣ.
Otherwise we use 'ⲡ'. Note that there's also 'ⲡⲓ' which is more general and less specific.
ⲣⲏϯ: condition/status (حالة)
ⲙ: possession marker that comes before ⲡ, ⲫ, ⲃ, ⲙ and ⲯ (otherwise we use ⲛ). Like 'of' in English or 'de' in Spanish, it relates ⲣⲏϯ to ⲡⲉⲕⲉϩⲟⲟⲩ i.e. the status 'of' your day.
ⲡⲉ: feminine 2nd person (i.e. feminine you) possessive adjective for a masculine object
ⲉϩⲟⲟⲩ: day/يوم/نهار (a masculine word)

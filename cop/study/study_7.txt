<bold>Tips:

<bold>ⲡⲁⲣⲁⲛ ⲡⲉ ⲛⲟϩⲉ: My name is Noha

The ⲡⲁ attached to ⲣⲁⲛ means my, ⲣⲁⲛ means name.
Because ⲣⲁⲛ is a masculine noun, the possessive noun used is ⲡⲁ. If it was a feminine noun, then the possessive noun would be ⲧⲁ.

<bold>ⲁϣ ⲡⲉ ⲡⲉⲕⲣⲁⲛ/ⲡⲉⲣⲁⲛ: What is your name?

ⲁϣ: what
ⲡⲉ: is
ⲡⲉⲕ/ⲡⲉ attached to ⲣⲁⲛ means "your", and ⲡⲉⲕ is used when addressing a male, and ⲡⲉ is used when addressing a female.
ⲣⲁⲛ means name.


<bold>ⲁⲛⲟⲕ ⲟⲩⲣⲉⲙⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ ⲡⲉ/ⲧⲉ: I am an Egyptian

ⲁⲛⲟⲕ: I
ⲟⲩ: an (indefinite article)
ⲣⲉⲙⲛ: Person of (ⲣⲉⲙ: person ⲛ: of)
ⲭⲏⲙⲓ: Egypt (Black)
ⲡⲉ/ⲧⲉ: am
ⲡⲉ is for a male subject and ⲧⲉ is for a female subject.

Note: when the noun is indefinite, the verb "ⲡⲉ/ⲧⲉ" follows the noun.
ⲟⲩⲣⲉⲙⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ means “an Egyptian” so it is indefinite, so the verb ⲡⲉ will follow it.

However when the nouns are definite, the verb proceeds the noun.

<bold>ⲁⲛⲟⲕ ⲡⲉ ⲡⲓⲣⲉⲙⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ: I am the Egyptian

In this case “The Egyptian” is definite so ⲡⲉ comes before the noun.

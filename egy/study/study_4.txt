<bold>Lesson Number 4 "Letters"

In this lesson you will learn the following letters:
‎ط,ق,ت

ط^§: Tah
- Similar to English "T"

§ ق^§: KAf
- Similar to English "K"

§ ت^§: teh
- It is an English "T"


You may have noticed the dashed lines that can appear above or below arabic letter as below:
تِ تَ
In Arabic there are more symbols that go above and below letters
.
The first  َ  is called Fat-ha, and goes above the letter. Any letter you find a Fat-ha above it, must have a short "a" pronounced after that letter.

The second   ِ  is called Kas-ra, and goes below a letter, and is pronounced as a short “i” after the letter it appears on.

Lets take this example of the word "You":
‎إنتِ is pronounced enti: Means "You" when addressing a female
‎إنتَ is pronounced enta: Means "You" when addressing a male

Many egyptians prefer not to use Fat-ha and Kas-ra when writing and simply add a letter, also they may not care to use the correct alef, as they simply memorize how the vowels will be:
‎إنتِ is written إنتي or انتي or أنتي or انت
‎إنتَ is pronounced إنتا or أنتا or انت or أنت

etc….

Remember that colloquial Egyptian is not a standard language so expect minor differences in writing.

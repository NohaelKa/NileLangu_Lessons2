Basics:
Arabic is read from right to left.

How are you: إزيِك/إزيَك
The word إزاي when used on it's own means "How", and can be used as a question word.
In the "How are you" expression, an ا is removed after the ز. When you do that it becomes إزي, meaning "How is/are". You can put any noun after that to say How is/are X. The word "You" is trasnlated literally as "إنتَ" or "إنتِ" depending if you are speaking to a male or female. However in this expression "You" becomes the letter "K" = "ك", and it is attached at the end of the word becoming إزيَك or إزيِك.

Male and Female:
Nouns in Arabic are always either male or female, the same holds true in Egyptian Arabic.
For example the word "Cat" can be "قط" for male or "قطة" for female.
As a general rule, if a word end with a "ة", it is a female. Notice that "ة" letter takes a different form in the "قطة" example, and thats true for most of the letters.

Possession:
To indicate possession of the listener, usually there will be a "ك" added at the end of a word

Examples:
قطتك :Your cat
شغلِك :Your work

To indicate possession of the speaker, usually there will be a "ي" added at the end of a word

Examples
قطتي : My cat
شغلي : My work

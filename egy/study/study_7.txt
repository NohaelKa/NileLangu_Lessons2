<bold>Lesson Number 7 "Feminine and Masculine"

In this lesson you will learn about Feminine and Masuline words

دا^§: This (for masculine words)

دي^§: This (for feminine words)


It is easy to differentiate between masculine and feminine nouns.

Firstly, the word ends with the letter ة Then it is a feminine word. (ة is Pronounced in Egyptian Arabic as an ”a”)

Examples:
عربية^§
كرة^§
قطة^§


Secondly if the word is originally foreign, but ends in “a” letter, then Egyptians will treat it as a feminine word.
Examples:
This Orchestra would be الأوركسترا دي

Elorchestra dy (dy is “This” for feminine nouns)

<bold>Lesson Number 8 "Pronouns"

In this lesson you will learn about the pronouns.

In Arabic and Egyptian Arabic there is no verb to be, the pronoun already includes it in the meaning.
So the sentence "I am Noha" for example, can simply be "‎أنا نهى", "am" is not needed.

With the basic pronouns, you will be able to form basic nominal sentences.

<b>Lesson Number 3 "What foods do we have?"</b>

In this lesson you will learn about some food names and the phrase "Is there" and the responses.

The word "في" [fi] means "there is", and can be used as follows.
There is milk: في لبن
Is there milk?: في لبن؟

Notice that there is is no need to put a question word to ask "Is there", you can simply use "في" .
This question can be used for example when you are asking someone if an object exists in their home,or asking an supermarket employee if this object exists at their supermarket.
Yes, there is Wifi: ايوه، في وايفاي

The word "عندنا" [(ae)ndena] means "We have", and can be used as follows.
We have cheese: عندنا جبنه
Do we have cheese?: عندنا جبنه؟

Negation
In Egyptian Arabic, negating a verb can usually have a structure. You add "م" at the beginning and "ش" at the end of the verb.
This grammer rule does not exist in the classical fus-ha arabic.

Example:
The word "There is" which is "في" becomes "مفيش"
The word "We have" which is "عندنا" becomes "معندناش"
